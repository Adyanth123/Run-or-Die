# Run-or-Die

This is my project named Run or Die. The goal of this game is to keep obtaining coins while trying not to die to spikes or wood. There are progressive levels, for example at score 6, 2 spikes get added, at score 11, 2 more spikes get added, at score 16, 4 spikes get added and at score 24, 4 more spikes get added.The movement of the player can be controled either by the WASD or the arrow keys. If W or the up arrow is pressed, the pler moves up, if D or the right arrow is pressed it moves right, if A or the left arrow is pressed it moves left and finally, if S or the down arrow is pressed the player moves down. There is bg music included and every time you die or restart the game it shuffles between 8 other music. There is a new game screen when you die.
